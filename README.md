## TIPS
* Don't use white space around =
* If variable already exists, then new value will override old value
* Bash variables has no data type. Stores variables as strings
* Only letters,numbers and underscore are allowed for variables
* First character should be a letter or an underscore
* Variable names are case sensitive
* Good Habit : user lowercase for variables
* Use double quotes for variable substitutions. ex "${HOME}"
